Knowledge is meant to be shared. At least that's my personal philosophy. Luckily, or unluckily depending on your view the internet, as a species we have the ability to put thoughts to words and images. This allows the sharing of ideas.

This concept is what is the foundation of this site. I am used to creating sites for others: small companies, charities, independent writers, and others. Yet every time I wanted to do something for myself I ran into stumbling blocks.

## Can you really do it?

The most obvious being something I feel most of us suffer from- Imposter Syndrome. Do I have anything of value to share? Why would someone listen to me over someone who has been around a year or longer? You know the questions we hit ourselves with.

After years of having ideas, starting them up, working on them, I finally came to a decision. Just put up what helps me. Maybe someone somewhere will be able to benefit from my knowledge. Maybe not.

## My solution

Considering I have over 20 years experience in the world of technology, I find myself forgetting things: syntax, concepts, ideas, etc. Why not put them in a place that I can refer back to?

This post is my celebratory "Hey, look, a new website" post. Consider this my way of sharing my knowledge. Hopefully it helps.
