## SudoVersity

This website is where I store ideas, thoughts, snippets, and other things I want to remember, keep track of, or share. I've been around for so long now that I am starting to forget things. Ha! ðŸ˜‚

I wanted a place to put thoughts that others may find, build on, use, explore, or even ignore. There are thoughts about games I play, code I write, philosphies I follow, books I read, and everything in between.

### Contents

The contents found in this site are written by me, [Josey Howarth](/authors/sudomistress/). Images are sourced from locations like Pexels, Unsplash, Pixabay, etc.
